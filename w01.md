# Top 10 List of Week 01

1. [UNIX Operating System](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/unix-introduction/)<br>
Unix and Unix-like operating systems are a family of computer operating systems that are derived from the original Unix System from Bell Labs. Unix is the most powerful and popular multi-user and multi-tasking Operating System. The basic concepts of Unix were originated in the Multics project of 1969. The Multics system was intended as a time-sharing system that would allow multiple users to simultaneously access a mainframe computer.

2. [Components of Operating System](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_concepts/computer_concepts_operating_system_types.htm)<br>
An operating system is a large and complex system that can only be created by partitioning into small pieces. These pieces should be a well-defined portion of the system, which carefully defined inputs, outputs, and functions.

3. [Free Software vs Open Source Software](https://dzone.com/articles/free-software-vs-open-source-vs-freeware-whats-the)<br>
Free software is the software that grants the user the freedom to share, study, and modify it. It allows you to do anything you want with it, even improving the version and profiting from it.
While open source, is a development philosophy that is more business oriented. OSI asserts that any open source software must adhere to the following criteria: free redistribution of the software, the source code should be publicly available, the software can be modified and distributed in a different format from the original software, the software should not discriminate against persons or groups, the software should not restrict the usage of other software.

4. [Virtual Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine)<br>
a virtual machine (VM) is an emulation of a computer system. Virtual machines are based on computer architectures and provide functionality of a physical computer. Their implementations may involve specialized hardware, software, or a combination.

5. [Cloud Computing](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-cloud-computing-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-cloud/)<br>
Cloud computing is the delivery of on-demand computing services -- from applications to storage and processing power -- typically over the internet and on a pay-as-you-go basis.

9. [C Language Introduction](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-language-set-1-introduction/)<br>
C is a procedural programming language. It was initially developed by Dennis Ritchie in the year 1972. It was mainly developed as a system programming language to write an operating system. The main features of C language include low-level access to memory, a simple set of keywords, and clean style, these features make C language suitable for system programmings like an operating system or compiler development.
