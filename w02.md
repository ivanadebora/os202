1. [File System Manipulation](https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/file-system-manipulation/)<br>
This article shows how to perform tasks involving reading and writing files from various partitions by using the C#.net programming API. It also covers exploring the directory structure, finding out what files and folders are present, and performing other file-related operations, such as moving, copying, and deleting objects from the disk.

2. [Real Time Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing)<br>
Real-time computing is a term of hardware and software system subject to a "real-time constraint". There are few term to be understood, like: real-time programs, real-time processes, real-time responses, real-time software, etc.

3. [What is an API?](https://www.howtogeek.com/343877/what-is-an-api/)<br>
API or Application Programming Interface is a bunch of operation that is used and ordered by developers, that along with descriptions of what it do. APIs are also used to control access to hardware devices and software functions that an application may not necessarily have permission to use, that also APIs are also used to control access to hardware devices and software functions that an application may not necessarily have permission to use.

4. [Access matrix in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/access-matrix-in-operating-system/)<br>
Access Matrix is a security model of protection state in computer system. It is represented as a matrix. Access matrix is used to define the rights of each process executing in the domain with respect to each object. 

5. [Computer Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security)<br>
Computer security or cybersecurity is the protection of computer systems and networks from the theft of or damage to their hardware,software, or electronic data, as well as from the disruption or misdirection of the services they provide.

6. [Security Problems](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/15_Security.html)<br>
This article explains about security problems based on the book "Operating System Concepts" by Silberschatz, et al.

7. [ACL: Access Control List](https://www.ittsystems.com/access-control-list-acl/)<br>
An ACL is one of the most fundamental components of security. An Access Control Lists “ACL” is a function that watches incoming and outgoing traffic and compares it with a set of defined statements.
