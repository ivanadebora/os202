# Top 10 List of Week 00

1. [What is an Operating System](https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/computerbasics/understanding-operating-systems/1/)<br>
An operating system is the most important software that runs on a computer. It manages the computer's memory and processes, as well as all of its software and hardware.

2. [Types of Operating System](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_concepts/computer_concepts_operating_system_types.htm)<br>
There are four types of operating systems: Real-time, Single-User/Single-Tasking, Single-User/Multitasking, and Multi-User/Multitasking operating system.

3. [DMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_memory_access)<br>
Direct memory access (DMA) is a computer system feature that allows a particular hardware subsystem to access the main system memory (random access memory) independently of the central processing unit (CPU).

4. [Interrupt Handlers](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19620-01/805-3024/6j2sumi1n/index.html)<br>
An interrupt is a hardware signal from a device to the CPU. It tells the CPU that the device needs attention and that the CPU should stop performing what it is doing and respond to the device.

5. [Types of Interrupts](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19620-01/805-3024/6j2sumi1q/index.html)<br>
There are two common ways in which buses implement interrupts: vectored and polled.

6. [Multiprocessor and Multicomputer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-multiprocessor-and-multicomputer/#:~:text=A%20Multiprocessor%20is%20a%20computer,fault%20tolerance%20and%20application%20matching.)<br>
A Multiprocessor is a computer system with two or more central processing units (CPUs) share full access to a common RAM. While, a multicomputer system is a computer system with multiple processors that are connected together to solve a problem.

7. [Multithreading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multithreading_(computer_architecture)#:~:text=In%20computer%20architecture%2C%20multithreading%20is,This%20approach%20differs%20from%20multiprocessing.)<br>
Multithreading is the ability of a central processing unit (CPU) (or a single core in a multi-core processor) to provide multiple threads of execution concurrently, supported by the operating system.

8. [Concurrency in Operating Systems](https://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS2230/handouts/Lecture09/lecture9.pdf)<br>
Concurrency is the execution of several instruction sequences at the same time. In an operating system, this happens when there are several process threads running in parallel. These threads may communicate with each other through either shared memory or message passing.

9. [Cluster System](https://prepinsta.com/operating-systems/clustered-system/)<br>
Clustered Operating Systems resembles parallel operating systems as they possess multiple CPUs. However, a cluster is created when two or more computer systems are merged. Primarily, in a cluster, computers share common storage, and the system works together.

10. [Operating Systems Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10)<br>
Operating systems management allows an organization to stay current on patches, upgrades, and other elements of the operating system, while keeping its own in-house IT professionals free to handle tasks specific to the operation of the business.
